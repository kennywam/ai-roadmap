## Topics Covered

### 1. Introduction to AI Agents
- What are AI agents?
- Agent vs Traditional AI systems
- Types of agents (reactive, deliberative, hybrid)
- Agent architectures and frameworks

### 2. Agent Components
- **Perception**: Environment sensing and input processing
- **Planning**: Goal setting and strategy development
- **Action**: Tool usage and environment manipulation
- **Memory**: Short-term and long-term information storage
- **Learning**: Adaptation and improvement over time

### 3. Tools and Environment Integration
- Tool calling and API integration
- Web browsing and search capabilities
- File system operations
- Database interactions
- External service integrations

### 4. Agent Frameworks and Libraries
- **LangChain Agents**: Tools, executors, and custom agents
- **AutoGPT**: Autonomous task execution
- **LangGraph**: State-based agent workflows
- **CrewAI**: Multi-agent collaboration
- **Semantic Kernel**: Microsoft's agent framework

### 5. Planning and Reasoning
- Chain-of-thought reasoning
- Planning algorithms (A*, STRIPS)
- Task decomposition and scheduling
- Error handling and recovery
- Constraint satisfaction

### 6. Multi-Agent Systems
- Agent communication protocols
- Coordination and collaboration
- Distributed problem solving
- Consensus mechanisms
- Agent roles and specialization

## Exercises

1. **Basic Agent Implementation**
   - Create a simple task-executing agent
   - Implement tool calling capabilities
   - Add memory and context management
   - Test with various tasks and tools

2. **Research Assistant Agent**
   - Build an agent that can research topics
   - Integrate web search and document processing
   - Implement fact-checking and source validation
   - Create structured research reports

3. **Multi-Agent System**
   - Design a system with specialized agents
   - Implement agent communication
   - Create a collaborative task workflow
   - Test with complex, multi-step problems

## Code Examples

```python
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, Tool
from langchain.agents import AgentType
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchRun

# Define tools
search = DuckDuckGoSearchRun()
tools = [
    Tool(
        name="Search",
        func=search.run,
        description="Search for current information"
    )
]

# Initialize agent
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
agent = initialize_agent(
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm,
    agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    verbose=True
)

# Custom agent with memory
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory

memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key="chat_history")
conversational_agent = initialize_agent(
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm,
    agent=AgentType.CONVERSATIONAL_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    memory=memory,
    verbose=True
)

# Multi-agent system example
class ResearchAgent:
    def __init__(self, name, specialty):
        self.name = name
        self.specialty = specialty
        self.llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
    
    def research(self, topic):
        # Implement research logic
        pass
    
    def collaborate(self, other_agents, task):
        # Implement collaboration logic
        pass
```
