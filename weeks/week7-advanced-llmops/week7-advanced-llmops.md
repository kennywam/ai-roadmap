- Edge deployment considerations

### 3. Monitoring and Observability
- Application performance monitoring (APM)

- Log aggregation and analysis
- Error tracking and alerting
- Dashboard creation and visualization

### 4. Cost Management
- Token usage tracking and optimization
- Model selection based on cost-performance
- Caching to reduce API calls
- Rate limiting and quota management
- Cost allocation and chargeback

### 5. Security and Governance
- API security and authentication
- Data privacy and compliance (GDPR, HIPAA)
- Prompt injection prevention
- Content filtering and moderation
- Audit logging and compliance reporting

### 6. Testing and Quality Assurance
- Unit testing for LLM applications
- Integration testing with external APIs
- Load testing and performance benchmarking
- A/B testing for model comparisons
- Regression testing for model updates

### 7. MLOps Pipeline Integration
- CI/CD for LLM applications
- Model versioning and registry
- Automated testing and validation
- Deployment automation
- Rollback strategies

## Exercises

1. **Production Deployment Setup**
   - Containerize an LLM application
   - Deploy to cloud platform (AWS/GCP/Azure)
   - Set up monitoring and logging
   - Configure auto-scaling

2. **Monitoring Dashboard**
   - Create comprehensive monitoring setup
   - Track key performance indicators
   - Set up alerting for anomalies
   - Implement cost tracking

3. **Complete LLMOps Pipeline**
   - Build end-to-end CI/CD pipeline
   - Implement automated testing
   - Set up staging and production environments
   - Create rollback and recovery procedures

## Code Examples

```python
# Docker configuration
# Dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .
EXPOSE 8000

CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]

# FastAPI application with monitoring
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from prometheus_fastapi_instrumentator import Instrumentator
import logging
import time

app = FastAPI()

# Prometheus metrics
Instrumentator().instrument(app).expose(app)

# Logging configuration
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

@app.middleware("http")
async def log_requests(request, call_next):
    start_time = time.time()
    response = await call_next(request)
    process_time = time.time() - start_time
    
    logger.info(f"Path: {request.url.path}, "
                f"Method: {request.method}, "
                f"Status: {response.status_code}, "
                f"Duration: {process_time:.4f}s")
    
    return response
