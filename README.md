# ðŸ§  AI Engineer Learning Roadmap

This is a hands-on, project-based roadmap for software engineers who want to build with LLMs, RAG pipelines, NLP, OCR, and agentic systems using tools like LangChain, LangGraph, and Hugging Face.

## ðŸ“† Roadmap Timeline (8 Weeks)

| Week | Topic                              | Focus                                     |
|------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 1    | LLM Foundations                    | Transformers, Prompting, OpenAI API       |
| 2    | LangChain Basics                  | Chains, Prompts, Memory                   |
| 3    | NLP + Hugging Face                | NER, classification, transformers         |
| 4    | RAG Pipelines                     | Vector DBs, Embeddings, Chroma            |
| 5    | OCR + Document Parsing            | Tesseract, NER, Invoice data extraction   |
| 6    | Agentic Models                    | LangGraph, agent tools, planners          |
| 7    | LLMOps & Evaluation               | LangSmith, Helicone, CrewAI               |
| 8    | Final Full-stack AI App           | Combine RAG + Agents + UI                 |

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

- `weeks/` - One markdown file per week (learning modules)
- `projects/` - Code, notes, and instructions for final projects
- `resources.md` - External learning resources

---

## ðŸš€ How to Use This Repo

1. Clone the repo and open the `weeks/` folder.
2. Follow each weekâ€™s `.md` file in order.
3. Track your progress using the checkboxes.
4. Use the `projects/` folder to apply what youâ€™ve learned.
5. Optionally deploy your projects to Vercel or Streamlit.

Happy hacking! ðŸš€
