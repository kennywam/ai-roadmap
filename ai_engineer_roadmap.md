- LLM types: GPT, LLaMA, Claude, PaLM, etc.
- Prompt engineering: zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought

**Tools:** OpenAI API, Anthropic API

**Resources:**

- Illustrated Transformer (Jay Alammar)
- OpenAI Playground & API Docs
- Prompt Engineering Guide (DAIR)

---

## 🛠 Phase 2: Using LLMs & Prompt Engineering

### ✅ Week 2: LLM Integration & LangChain Basics

- Build first app with OpenAI or Hugging Face

**Project:** Build a Q&A Bot using LangChain + OpenAI

**Resources:**

- LangChain Docs: LLM, PromptTemplate, Memory
- Hugging Face transformers pipeline

---

## 🔍 Phase 3: NLP, Embeddings & Hugging Face

### ✅ Week 3: NLP with Transformers

- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Text classification, summarization
- Tokenizers and pipelines

**Project:** News classifier or sentiment analyzer

**Tools:** Hugging Face, `transformers`, `datasets`, `gradio`

---

## 📦 Phase 4: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

### ✅ Week 4: RAG Architecture
